### Setup and running
This project use [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to manage dependencies in a hassle-free way.
It works a lot like npm. After cloning the repo, simply run:
```shell script
$ pipenv install
```
to install all necessary dependencies.

Pipenv automatically sets up a virtual environment. You can enter it with
```shell script
$ pipenv shell
```

and run all subsequent commands from there.
