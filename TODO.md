# TODO

## Week 2
### TODO
- [ ] Streamline simulation API so that running experiments in notebooks is easier
    - [ ] Data loading for Omniglot
    - [x] Generalize simulation setup and running
    - [x] More flexible input encoding
    - [x] Utility plotting functions
    - [x] Distance metrics
    - [ ] Supervision
    - [ ] Code documentation (not crucial)
- [ ] Half-on, half-off experiment
- [ ] Check sparsity of Omniglot data
- [ ] Run experiment with supervision (on a subset of characters)
- [ ] Reconstruct MAT model to better understand it

### DONE
- [x] Clean up codebase and push to git repo
